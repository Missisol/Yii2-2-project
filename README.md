# Task-manager

 Task management in projects.
 
 The project involves users in different roles: manager, developer, tester.
 
 The manager can create and update tasks  in the projects assigned to him.
 The developer can take and complete tasks in the projects assigned to him.
 The tester can comment on tasks.
 For discussion of projects the chat on web sockets is implemented.
